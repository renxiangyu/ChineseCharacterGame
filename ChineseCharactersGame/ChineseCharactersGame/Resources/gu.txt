春晓
The pring dawn
孟浩然 著(唐朝）
written by Meng Haoran(Dynasty Tang)

春眠不觉晓，
This morn of spring in bed I'm lying,
处处闻啼鸟。
Not to awake till birds are crying.
夜来风雨声，
After one night of wind and showers,
花落知多少。
How many are the fallen flowers!


观 沧 海
Gazing Out Across the Ocean
曹操 著(三国）
written by Cao Cao(Dynasty the Three Kingdoms)

东临碣石，一观沧海。
Come east of Jieshi Cliff,I gaze out across the ocean, 
水何澹澹，山岛竦峙。
Its rolling waves studded with rocks and islets; 
树木丛生，百草丰茂。
Dense the trees and bushes here, rank the undergrowth; 
秋风萧瑟，洪波涌起。 
The autumn wind is soughing, huge billows are breaking.
日月之行，若出其中；
Sun and moon take their course ,as if risen from the sea;  
星汉灿烂，若出其里，
The bright galaxy of stars seems sprung from the deep .
幸甚至哉，歌一咏志。
And so , with joy in my heart, I hum this song.

　　　
江南春绝句
Spring in the Yangtze Delta 
杜牧 著（唐）
written by Du Mu(Dynasty Tang)

千里莺啼绿映红， 水村山郭酒旗风。
Orioles can be heard singing amid the red and green for a thousand li, 
And wineshop streamers flutter in lakeside villages and hillside towns.  
南朝四百八十寺， 多少楼台烟雨中。
Of the 480 temples built by the Southern Dynasties, 
Many towers and terraces still remain erect in the misty rain.


送杜少府之任蜀州
王勃 著（唐）
written by Wang Bo(Dynasty Tang)

Bidding Deputy Magistrate Du Farewell
城阙铺三秦，风烟望五津。 
The capital and palace are guarded by the land of three Qin kingdoms, 
in the distance the Five Ferries are screened by wind and mist. 
与君离别意，同是宦游人。
Now comes the time for us to bid farewell to each other, 
and we will both be officials away from home on duty.  
海内存知己，天涯若比邻。
So long as we remain bosom friends in our heart of hearts, 
we'll still feel like neighbours despite the distance apart.
无为在歧路，儿女工沾巾。 
So don't let us shed silly tears like youngsters,
at that last moment when we both wave goodbye.


行路难
Travelling is Hard
李白 著（唐）
written by Li Bai(Dynasty Tang)
 
金樽清酒斗十千，玉盘珍羞直万钱。 
Clear wine in golden goblets, ten thousand cash a cup, 
and costly delicacies on jade platter. 
停杯投箸不能食，拔剑四顾心茫然。
Yet I spurn drinking and toss away my chopsticks, 
sword in hand, restless, I wonder what to do.  
欲渡黄河冰塞川，将登太行雪满山。 
I want to cross the Yellow River, but it's ice-bound; 
I want to climb the Taihang Mountains, but they're snow-covered. 
闲来垂钓碧溪上，忽复乘舟梦日边。
So idly I fish by a limid stream, 
dreaming of sailing towards the sun. 
行路难！行路难！多歧路，今安在？ 
Travelling is hard! Travelling is hard! 
So many crossroad; which to choose? 
长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。 
One day I'll skim the waves,blown by the wind, 
with sails hoisted high, across the vast ocean.
